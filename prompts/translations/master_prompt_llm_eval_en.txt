## Input
- User consultation text
- Household budget data (expense item names are limited to those included here)

## Your Task
Based on the user's household financial situation, provide specific analysis and advice to improve their budget.

## Numeric Output (Highest Priority)
- **At the very end of your response, output ONLY JSON**
- Do not include any non-JSON text (explanations, notes, etc.)

## Output JSON Structure (Strict)
```json
{
  "advice_text": "<advice text for improving the household budget>",
  "reduction_plan": {
    "<expense item name>": {
      "reduction_rate": <real number between 0 and 1>
    }
  }
}
```

## Required Output Items
- You must output **all expense items** included in the household budget data
- For items with no reduction, set the value to `0.0`

## Definition of Reduction Rate
- `reduction_rate = reduction_amount / current_amount`
- Output `reduction_rate` as a value **rounded to the 5th decimal place**
- Example: `0.28846`

## Requirements for advice_text
- Write in natural English

## Prohibited Actions (Strict)
- Creating new expense item names that do not exist in the household budget data
- Combining multiple expense items and outputting one shared reduction rate
- Adding keys other than `reduction_rate`
- Changing the JSON structure
