    "advice_text": "To strengthen financial resilience during a job change, prioritize reductions that are both sustainable and immediately impactful. First, review insurance coverage and remove overlapping benefits; a moderate premium cut can often be achieved without sacrificing essential protection. Next, set a monthly target for miscellaneous spending by identifying recurring small expenses and consolidating them into a fixed budget. Keep housing and utilities stable for now, and apply only modest reductions to food and communication to avoid lowering quality of life too much.",
